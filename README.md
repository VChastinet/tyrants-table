A turn manager for RPG sessions

### Stack proposal:
  * [react native-web](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-web): brings the platform-agnostic Components and APIs of React Native to the Web. (will make it easy if the need for an mobile app appears);
  * [next.js](https://nextjs.org/): boilerplate that abstracts many architectural decisions (kind of an overkill);
  * [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/): google's serveless will make it really easy to do authentication and will abstract the need of building an API from scratch;
